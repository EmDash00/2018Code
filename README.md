# 2018Code

This is a fork of Team135BlackKnights 2018Code Repo, which was made by me on my time on the Penn Robotics Team for the FIRST Robotics Competition using WPILib.

2017 was a highly experimental year where we developed a new mecanum drive system for our robot which would be reused in the 2019 year following my graduation.
Our robot utilized several very tightly tuned control loops in order to function properly and reached a level of complexity in terms of programming not previously seen before.
